# Frontend Development Practice Repo

Welcome to my frontend development repository! 👨‍💻✨

This repo contains a collection of small to medium-level frontend projects and practice files created during my pre-final year. It's not about building large-scale applications — it's about staying consistent, improving steadily, and experimenting with new concepts.

## 📌 What's Inside?
- HTML/CSS practice files
- JavaScript snippets
- Mini UI components
- Form designs
- Basic responsive layouts
- Concept demos

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a personal log of frontend practice work. It reflects:
- My consistency in learning frontend during my pre-final year
- My growing understanding of web fundamentals
- Experimentation with different ideas and designs

## 📅 Status
Ongoing - I will keep adding new files as I practice and learn more.

## 💡 Note
This repo is not focused on full-fledged or production-ready projects. It’s more of a sandbox for trying out and reinforcing core frontend skills.

## 📬 Connect
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss frontend ideas, feedback, or collaboration!
